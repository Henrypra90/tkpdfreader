THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY. Anyone can use and modified it for any purpose. Just remember the author (in case of modification).

A pdf reader in Python3/tkinter based on PyMuPDF by Ruikai Liu and Jorj X. McKie. Required: PyMuPDF (included, no need to download it; Notice: in the fitz folder there is a compiled library file). This program uses custom file dialog instead of the default tkinter dialog. It is a slightly modified version of the project by Juliette Monsel (j_4321).

The first step toward an indipendent pdf reader.
Implemented: Toc, page selection/next/previous, zoom, page rotation, printing, metadata reading, encrypted pdf files (with password). In the doc folder there are two sample files: the password for the file pdf-password.pdf is password.
Hidden feature: Ctrl+LMB: selection to clipboard.
